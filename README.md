This was definitely a challenging project considering the deadline I set for myself. Fortunately, I managed to accomplish my goal of learning more about Axios, APIs, Google Cloud Platform, Google Maps React, TailwindCSS and React.js in general.

### Description

Travelix is a full-fledged and responsive travel companion that dynamically shows the best restaurants, hotels and attractions based on your or your searched location. On load it displays your current location, but you can search for your future destinations in advance to get familiar with your options.
